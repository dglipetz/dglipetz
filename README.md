**Introduction**  
Hi! My name is Dan. I am currently working as a Lead Analyst for the Energy Efficiency Analytics group at Duke Energy. 
I previously spent five years as a nuclear systems engineer and design engineer with Duke Energy at the Harris Nuclear Plant and have also worked as a 
stress analyst on the Airbus A350 XWB and a R&D engineer in the robotic medical device field. I have extensive multidisciplinary experience in system engineering, 
failure and process analysis, and developing code and processes for improving efficiency and accuracy. 

I graduated NC State University with a BS in Aerospace Engineering in 2013 and with a MS in Merchanical Engineering in 2016. I was certified as a Professional Engineer in North Carolina in July, 2017. I graduated with a MS in Analytics from Georgia Tech in 2020.

I am pursuing a role in data science which utilizes my knowledge and experience with statistical analysis and predictive modeling.

I have foundational knowledge and experience in the following,  

**Languages & Technologies**  
-Python  
-Visual Basic  
-R  
-SQL  
-Hadoop MapReduce  
-d3  

**Techniques & Algorithms**  
-Dimensionality Reduction & Principal Component Analysis  
-Linear Regression  
-Density Estimation  
-Classification (ex. Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes)  
-Clustering (ex. K-means, Spectral, Expectation-Maximization, Gaussian Mixture Modeling)  
-Boosting
